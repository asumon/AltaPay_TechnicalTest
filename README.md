# TODO

- Change the code to process only files starting with '82242267' and ending with '0000'. The files can be found in "data" folder
- Run the project and fix any possible issues 
- Change the code to validate 'event_code' column to accept only rows with values (107,106,105)
- Extract at least 2 business insights (i.e. daily transaction volume) based on 'data/82242267.20210201T000000+0000.csv' dataset: please write query for them and elaborate your choice
- Look at the file 'ML/ML test.docx' and answer both of the questions in there
